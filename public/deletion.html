  <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
  <p>Last updated: December 18, 2025</p>
  <p>You can delete your Ride account and all associated data (trips, notes, attachments, sessions) at any time.</p>

  <h2>Request Deletion</h2>
  <p>Email us at <strong>support@ride.incitat.io</strong> from the email address used for your Ride account. Include the subject line “Ride Data Deletion Request.”</p>
  <p>We will verify ownership and delete your data within 30 days, usually much sooner.</p>

  <h2>What Gets Deleted</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your account and authentication linkage.</li>
    <li>All trips, waypoints, notes, and attachments you own.</li>
    <li>All active sessions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Stays</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimal operational logs retained briefly for security and abuse prevention.</li>
    <li>If you shared a trip publicly and others cached the link/data, we cannot control third-party caches.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have questions, contact <strong>support@ride.incitat.io</strong>.</p>
