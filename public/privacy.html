      <h1>Ride Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="doc-meta">Last updated: December 18, 2025</p>
      <p>Ride helps you plan and share trips. We collect only what is necessary to provide the service and never sell your data.</p>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Account info: email and name from your chosen sign-in provider (Google, Microsoft, or Facebook).</li>
        <li>Trip content you create: trips, waypoints, notes, attachments, and sharing settings.</li>
        <li>Technical data: basic device/browser info and request logs for reliability and security.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticate you and secure your account.</li>
        <li>Store and sync your trips and related content.</li>
        <li>Show shared trips when you enable public sharing.</li>
        <li>Maintain service reliability, prevent abuse, and improve user experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your trips stay private unless you explicitly enable public sharing. Public shares expose only the fields you choose (waypoints, route, public notes, cover image).</li>
        <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
        <li>We may share data with service providers strictly to operate Ride.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your content is retained while your account is active.</li>
        <li>You can request deletion at any time (see Data Deletion below).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can disable public sharing for any trip.</li>
        <li>You can delete trips, notes, and attachments you own.</li>
        <li>You can request full account deletion (see Data Deletion below).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>To delete your account and all associated data, submit a request at <a href="/deletion.html">/deletion.html</a>. We will erase your account, trips, notes, attachments, and sessions.</p>
